# Common settings for this specific HelmRelease instance
# Namespace for the HelmRelease CR itself and where CouchDB will be deployed.
# This kustomization is expected to be included by a higher-level kustomization
# that already sets the namespace, or this can set it directly.
# For this example, we assume the parent (my-app-namespace-dev/kustomization.yaml) sets it.
